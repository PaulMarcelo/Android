# CheckBlurImage
CheckBlurImage
Application to assess whether an image is blurred or not.
The application connects to a web service that evaluates the image.
It is an alternative to using OpenVC directly in the Android project, which implies an increase in the size of the generator apk.
If you want to directly add OpenVC to the android project see this link:
